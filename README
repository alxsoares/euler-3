This project is just a collection of Groovy scripts
and some Java classes that I've used to solve various
Project Euler problems.

You can read more about the solutions and my thinking
behind them on my blog.

Most of the solutions for problems 1-100 were written
for Groovy 1.6.4 but later ones may be using 1.7.x
features. The blog comments on the solution will
note as such.

Have fun!
